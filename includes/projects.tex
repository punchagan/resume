        \item {\href{https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commits?author=punchagan}{Contributed} to Zulip in the past 2-3 years --- primarily to the server backend and web-frontend, but also a few small contributions to the Desktop and Terminal clients}
        \item {Made significant improvements to the URL previews for links shared on Zulip, the digest emails sent to users every week, and the soft-deactivation feature (a performance optimisation for users inactive for a couple of weeks)}
        \item {Built a screenshot tool using Puppeteer to make creation and updation of screenshots in the documentation much easier}
        \end{cvitems}

        \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item{\href{https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/commits?author=punchagan}{Contributed} to the Org mode source itself and to the general eco-sytem of tools, while using it for over a decade}
        \item{Created the \href{https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/commits?author=punchagan}{org2blog} package which makes blogging from Org mode to Wordpress a breeze. It has been used and loved by hundreds of Org mode bloggers. The package maintenance has been taken over by another user, since I don't have a Wordpress blog anymore}
        \item{Contributed to several other tools to add Org mode support to them, or to improve existing support including \href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/commits?author=punchagan}{pandoc} --- a popular tool to convert between different markup formats, \href{https://github.com/gollum/gollum/commits?author=punchagan}{gollum} --- the wiki system originally used by GitHub, and other such software}

        \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item {Contributed a handful of \href{https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/commits?author=punchagan}{features} to the Nikola blogging engine that include improvements to the GitHub pages deployment script, scheduling feature for posts and an \href{https://github.com/getnikola/plugins/tree/master/v8/orgmode}{Org mode markup compiler}}
        \item {Created a \href{https://punchagan.github.io/playo-find-venue/}{site} to make it easier to find an accessible \href{https://playo.co/}{Playo} (sports) venue with my friends, based on their locations. The site scrapes the Playo website nightly to show updated venue information}
        \item {Developed a couple of Chrome extensions for GitHub:
          \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2ex, nosep, noitemsep]
          \item[-] {\href{https://github.com/punchagan/GetHub}{GetHub} --- Chrome pop-up notifications for GitHub feed. This was used by a few hundred users, until I found it too noisy and stopped using and therefore developing it}
          \item[-] {\href{https://github.com/punchagan/github-cue}{github-cue} --- Recommendations for GitHub repos to star/watch based on users' currently watched repos. GitHub now has a built-in Explore Repositories feature that gives such recommendations}
          \end{itemize}
        }
        \item {Created an experimental \href{https://github.com/punchagan/crumb}{Disqus-like commenting system} that (ab)uses GitHub issues as the ``database"}
        \item {You can find some of my other projects and contributions on \href{https://github.com/punchagan}{GitHub}}
