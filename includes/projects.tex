        \item {Zulip is a messaging service for distributed systems with a threading model that works}
        \item {I've \href{https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commits?author=punchagan}{contributed} to the project in the past 2-3 years mainly to the server backend, but also a few to the Desktop and Terminal client}
        \item {I made significant improvements to the soft-deactivation feature --- a performance optimisation for users inactive since past few weeks, digest emails sent to users every week, URL previews for links shared on Zulip and a screenshot tool to make updation of screenshot documents easier}
        \end{cvitems}

      {
        \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item {\href{https://orgmode.org/}{Org mode} is a major mode in GNU Emacs for keeping notes, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming, etc}
        \item I've been using Org mode for over a decade, and have made \href{https://github.com/bzg/org-mode/commits?author=punchagan}{contributions} to the Org mode source itself, and the general eco-system.
        \item I created the package \href{https://github.com/org2blog/org2blog/commits?author=punchagan}{org2blog} to make it easy to blog from  Org mode to Wordpress. It has been used and loved by quite a few Org mode users. The package is currently not maintained by me, since I don't have a Wordpress blog anymore.
        \item I've made contributions to several other tools to add Org mode support to it, or to improve existing support including \href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/commits?author=punchagan}{pandoc} --- a popular tool to convert between different markup formats, \href{https://github.com/gollum/gollum/commits?author=punchagan}{gollum} --- the wiki system originally used by GitHub, and other tools in the eco-system.

      {
        \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item {Contributed a bunch of \href{https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/commits?author=punchagan}{features} to the Nikola blogging engine that include improvements to the GitHub pages deployment script, scheduling feature for posts and an \href{https://github.com/getnikola/plugins/tree/master/v8/orgmode}{Org mode markup compiler}}
        \item {Built a \href{https://punchagan.github.io/playo-find-venue/}{site} to make it easier to find an accessible \href{https://playo.co/}{Playo} (sports) venue with my friends, based on their locations. The site scrapes the Playo website nightly to show updated venue information}
        \item {Made a couple of Chrome extensions for GitHub: 1) \href{https://github.com/punchagan/GetHub}{GetHub} --- Chrome pop-up notifications for GitHub feed. This was used by a few hundred users, until I found it too noisy for myself and stopped using/developing it. 2) \href{https://github.com/punchagan/github-cue}{github-cue} --- Recommendations for GitHub repos to star/watch based on users' current watched repos. GitHub now has a built-in Explore Repositories feature}
        \item {Built an experimental \href{https://github.com/punchagan/crumb}{Disqus-like commenting system} that (ab)uses GitHub issues as the ``database"}
        \item {You can find some of my other projects and contributions on \href{https://github.com/punchagan}{GitHub}}
