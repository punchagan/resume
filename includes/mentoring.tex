        \item {\textbf{2020}: Mentored a student who worked on migrating some of the legacy components to newer tech stacks. The student was an experienced contributor and didn't need a lot of technical inputs from me. The student was appreciative of the regular check-ins we did, though}
        \item {\textbf{2019}: Mentored a student who worked on solidifying the email gateway and the message archive feature for Zulip. I helped bounce off some ideas, and did initial reviews of pull-requests}
        \item {\textbf{2018}: Mentored a student who built a terminal client for Zulip using it's API. The terminal client was the student's idea, and he had a fair sense of what he wanted to work on. I helped debug some tricky race conditions, bounced off ideas on the design and implementation of some features, and reviewed/merged pull-requests}
